### Customer Churn in Telecommunications

Customer churn, the loss of customers or subscribers, poses a significant challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and long-term growth. This project focuses on leveraging logistic regression to predict customer churn using a comprehensive telecommunications dataset.

### Overview
Customer churn, often measured monthly, indicates the percentage of lost customers relative to the total customer base. Understanding and anticipating churn is crucial for businesses aiming to retain customers and sustain growth. This analysis delves into identifying patterns and factors influencing churn behavior.

### Dataset
The telecommunications dataset employed in this analysis encompasses a range of customer attributes, service usage details, and churn indicators. It serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating predictive models to foresee potential churn cases.

### Key Steps
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and exploring data insights.

### Goal
The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that assists businesses in proactively identifying at-risk customers. By recognizing potential churners, companies can implement targeted retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction, thereby mitigating revenue loss.

### Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications domain, offering insights and methodologies applicable to similar business scenarios.
